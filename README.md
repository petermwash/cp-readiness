I am a tech lover, always striving to get to learn a new thing every day. I like challenges(and getting solutions for those challenges), risks and adventures as they make me feel lively. I am very passionate about software devolopment as it gives me the pleasure of facing new challenges time after time and solving them.

I love meeting new people, gettingg to know them and exchange ideas. I may seem a little quiet at a personal level but at a formal level I am very friendly and active.
