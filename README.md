I am a tech lover, always striving to get to learn a new thing every day. I like challenges(and getting solutions for those challenges), risks and adventures as they make me feel lively. I am very passionate about software devolopment as it gives me the pleasure of facing new challenges time after time and solving them.

I love meeting new people, getting to know them and exchange ideas. I may seem a little quiet at a personal level but at a formal level I am very friendly and active. 


##The google page imitation##

I have used materialize css the cdn version so you will need internet connection to be able to run the page.

Here is the link to the link to the google imitation page
